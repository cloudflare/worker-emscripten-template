# ðŸ‘· `worker-emscripten-template`

A template for kick starting a Cloudflare worker project with emscripten

[`index.js`](index.js) is the content of the Workers script.  
[`main.c`](src/main.c) is the c source code that calls into the stb image resizer library.  
[`build.js`](build.js) holds the command we use to call emscripten.  
[`webpack.config.js`](webpack.config.js) holds the webpack config we use to bundle the emscripten output together with your script.

To compile your C code to WebAssembly, this template uses [Emscripten](https://emscripten.org/docs/getting_started/downloads.html) if it is installed on your machine. Otherwise, it requires [docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) for providing the emscripten build environment.
